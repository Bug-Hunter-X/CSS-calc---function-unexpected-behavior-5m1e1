The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if used incorrectly with units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will cause issues because the second term is missing units.  Another common error involves using `calc()` with multiple calculations where the units aren't consistent, like: `margin: calc(50px + 10%)`. This can lead to unexpected layout behavior or errors in the browser's rendering engine.
